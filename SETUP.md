# Olefins Onboarding Tracker — Online (Supabase-backed) version

## What this is

This is a rebuild of the onboarding tracker as a real, live, multi-user web app — architecturally
identical to the ISO 17025 compliance tracker you already have running: a single HTML page +
`config.js` + a Postgres database on Supabase, hosted on GitHub Pages.

This solves the problem the old version had: the old tracker was a self-contained page that saved
its data *into itself* (via claude.ai's Artifact "publish" mechanism), so two people editing it at
the same time could overwrite each other's changes, and a downloaded/local copy couldn't save at
all. This version saves every change straight to a shared database, so:

- Everyone who opens the page sees the same live data.
- Two people can edit different people's records at the same time without conflicts.
- It works identically whether it's hosted on GitHub Pages, opened as a local file, or opened from
  a shared drive — there's no more "read-only local copy" problem.

## Files in this delivery

- **`index.html`** — the app itself. All the UI/course logic lives here. This is the updated
  (v3.1) version — see "Position changes / rotations" below for what's new.
- **`config.js`** — your Supabase project URL and public ("anon") key. This is what tells
  `index.html` which database to talk to. Safe to commit publicly — see the comment in the file.
  Unchanged from before — you don't need to re-copy it if you already have it in your repo.
- **`migration.sql`** — the original database schema (for reference / disaster recovery). **You do
  not need to run this** — it's already been applied to your Supabase project, and all 24 people's
  data has already been seeded into it.
- **`migration_v3.1_position_history.sql`** — the schema addition for the position-history feature.
  **Also already applied and backfilled** for you — kept for the same reference/disaster-recovery
  reason as `migration.sql`.

## Position changes / rotations (new)

On a person's page, there's now a **"Change position"** button next to their position pill. Use it
whenever someone is promoted, moves between labs (e.g. Oil → Gas), or transfers in from another
section:

- Their **Start Date stays untouched** — it's always their original hire date, no matter how many
  times they rotate.
- You pick the new position and an **effective date** (their Day 1 in the new role). The course
  schedule for their new position counts from that date, not their original start date.
- Any course they'd already **Passed** that also exists (by course code) in the new position's
  curriculum carries its Passed status forward automatically — they don't lose credit for
  training they've already completed. Anything genuinely new to the new position starts fresh.
- A **Position history** line appears on their page showing every past role and the dates they
  held it.

## Setting it up on GitHub Pages

## Where the data lives

Your existing Supabase project — "LSP Lab ISO 17025 Tracker" (the same one behind your ISO 17025
tracker) — now also has two new tables for this app: `onb_people` and `onb_settings`. They're
namespaced with an `onb_` prefix so they don't collide with the ISO tracker's own tables. All 24
people currently in the tracker (including the 4 newcomers) have already been loaded in.

## Setting it up on GitHub Pages

Since I don't have GitHub access from this session, these last steps are yours to do — they're the
same steps you (or whoever set up the ISO 17025 tracker) already did for that app:

1. **Create a GitHub repository** (or reuse/add a folder to an existing one) — e.g.
   `olefins-onboarding-tracker`. It can be public; nothing in these files is a secret (see the note
   in `config.js`).
2. **Add these three files** (`index.html`, `config.js`, `migration.sql`) to the repository, at the
   root (or in a `/docs` folder — see the next step).
3. **Enable GitHub Pages**: repository Settings → Pages → set the source branch (usually `main`)
   and folder (`/root` or `/docs`, matching where you put the files).
4. GitHub will give you a URL like `https://<your-username>.github.io/olefins-onboarding-tracker/`.
   That's the live link — share it with the team the same way you shared the ISO 17025 tracker's
   link.
5. Open the link and confirm you see the 24 people and their course data. If you set an admin
   password on the "Manage courses" panel in the old Artifact version, you'll need to set a new one
   here (via the 🔒 button next to "Manage courses") — passwords didn't carry over since they're
   stored per-app.

## A note on testing

I built and syntax-checked this app, and ran it through an automated test suite that simulates the
Supabase connection (add a person, remove a person, set an admin password, verify the course
dashboard renders, and — new for v3.1 — change a person's position and confirm the start date stays
put, the position history logs correctly, and a shared course keeps its Passed status while a
new-only course starts fresh) — everything passed. However, this sandbox's network access doesn't
reach Supabase or GitHub directly, so I have not been able to load the page against your *real*
database over the internet. Please do a quick smoke test after you publish it: open the page,
confirm the 24 people and their Passed/Not Started course statuses look right, add a test person
and refresh the page to confirm it's still there, then delete the test person. Also worth trying
the new Change Position flow once on a test person before relying on it for a real rotation.

## Everyday use

Nothing about how you use the tracker day-to-day changes — same dashboard, same course lists, same
"Manage courses" admin panel. The only difference is that every edit now saves straight to the
shared database instead of "publishing" a new version of the page, so there's no more save/share
button to think about — it just always reflects the latest data, for everyone.
